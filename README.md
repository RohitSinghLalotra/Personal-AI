# AI Virtual Assistant using Python

## Overview
This project is a Python-based AI Virtual Assistant developed with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter. The assistant supports both text and voice interaction, allowing users to communicate naturally. It uses speech recognition to process voice commands and text-to-speech technology to provide spoken responses. The assistant performs basic tasks such as telling the current time, opening websites, playing music, and responding to user queries.

## Objective
- To demonstrate the integration of speech recognition, text-to-speech, and GUI-based interaction.
- To understand the working of a simple virtual assistant using Python.
- To combine multiple Python libraries to build an interactive application.

## Features
- Converts voice input into text using the SpeechRecognition library.
- Converts text responses into speech using the pyttsx3 library.
- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.
- Chat window displaying user and assistant messages.
- Buttons for voice input (Ask), text input (Send), and delete.
- Displays and speaks the current time.
- Opens Google, YouTube, and Gaana using voice or text commands.
- Responds to greetings and common questions.
- Handles unknown commands gracefully.
- Safely closes the application using a shutdown command.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Tkinter for GUI development  
- SpeechRecognition for speech-to-text conversion  
- pyttsx3 for text-to-speech output  
- PIL (Pillow) for image handling  
- Webbrowser module for opening websites  
- Datetime module for time handling
